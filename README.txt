Make sure you have the latest version of JDK installed on your computer!
Go to java.com to download.

For Windows, to start the program, go into the "src" folder and double-click on "Shopping List.bat".

For Mac, to start the program, open terminal, type "cd", then drag the src folder into Terminal and press enter, then type in "java ShoppingList".

If you ask to export the list into a text file, it will appear inside the "src" folder.

Enjoy!
